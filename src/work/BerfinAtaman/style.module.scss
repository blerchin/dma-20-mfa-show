  /**
   * explanation for the following silly line of CSS:
   * because we are using a proportional-padded div to
   * contain the video, it does not work to set max-height. 
   * However, we know the ratio of the video, which in this 
   * case is 1:1.33. Therefore, we can set max-width to the 
   * (inverse of ratio * 100)vh and get a video that fits.
   * Back off by 2 or 3 vh to get a margin.
   * That was fun, wasn't it?

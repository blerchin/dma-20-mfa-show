1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,899
ACT ONE

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,266
This is about my broken heart

3
00:00:07,066 --> 00:00:08,788
You think through life a bit differently

4
00:00:08,813 --> 00:00:10,714
when you are told how this would all end

5
00:00:14,866 --> 00:00:16,732
That's the shock that people live

6
00:00:16,757 --> 00:00:18,490
their whole lives re-directing

7
00:00:22,899 --> 00:00:24,704
But my time is fixed to the signs

8
00:00:24,729 --> 00:00:25,625
my doctors use

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,914
to understand my heartbeat

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:30,966
My heartbeat is proving fatal

11
00:00:34,433 --> 00:00:35,547
Anyone should know that

12
00:00:35,572 --> 00:00:36,758
living in constant shock

13
00:00:36,783 --> 00:00:38,890
is not really shocking any longer

14
00:00:39,933 --> 00:00:41,966
It becomes something else entirely

15
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:45,833
My heartbeat was not always erratic

16
00:00:48,866 --> 00:00:51,214
At least I can't believe it
was always like this

17
00:00:53,833 --> 00:00:56,191
It never got so bad that
I would lose sensation

18
00:00:56,216 --> 00:00:58,148
in my chest and all sense of time

19
00:00:59,966 --> 00:01:02,090
It was pretty bad when it first started

20
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:05,333
I mean

21
00:01:05,258 --> 00:01:06,347
I think it is

22
00:01:06,372 --> 00:01:07,281
a little funny

23
00:01:10,099 --> 00:01:12,524
I was singing the song about the horses

24
00:01:14,766 --> 00:01:16,200
You must remember it

25
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,981
it is a very famous Cantonese melody

26
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,040
The song itself is about the potency

27
00:01:23,065 --> 00:01:25,190
of strength and
courage of these horses

28
00:01:27,633 --> 00:01:29,562
They escape the grasp of those that want

29
00:01:29,587 --> 00:01:30,687
claim to the land

30
00:01:30,611 --> 00:01:31,733
and if it wasn't the land

31
00:01:31,658 --> 00:01:33,588
it would be a claim to their bodies

32
00:01:33,613 --> 00:01:35,812
& they were forced to
always keep moving

33
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:38,844
Prevailing

34
00:01:38,869 --> 00:01:39,869
and so on

35
00:01:42,733 --> 00:01:46,000
You must remember this
song since it is very famous

36
00:01:46,566 --> 00:01:48,833
If I sing it for you,
you will recognize it

37
00:01:52,099 --> 00:01:54,420
When it gets translated
from Cantonese into English,

38
00:01:54,445 --> 00:01:56,057
it becomes a love song

39
00:01:59,900 --> 00:02:03,733
This is the reason why Sin Ya asked
me to perform this song at her wedding

40
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:09,099
There's a subliminal quality to it

41
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:13,935
When the audience heard
the beginning notes, they

42
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:15,790
clinked their glasses
and clapped their hands

43
00:02:17,099 --> 00:02:19,099
The simple joy in recognition

44
00:02:21,866 --> 00:02:26,300
When I entered the first chorus, I started
to feel my chest tighten and lost focus

45
00:02:27,533 --> 00:02:32,233
I no longer could control how I was hitting
my notes and my vision became blurry

46
00:02:34,566 --> 00:02:36,806
In that moment I also
realized that the English

47
00:02:36,831 --> 00:02:39,257
version of the song got
rid of the horses completely

48
00:02:41,566 --> 00:02:45,533
There was no longer any trace of
them in the words coming from my mouth

49
00:02:49,066 --> 00:02:50,657
I was taking part

50
00:02:50,682 --> 00:02:51,582
in a violence

51
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:52,604
towards these horses

52
00:02:57,866 --> 00:02:59,592
And like a wave that
reaches it's crest

53
00:02:59,617 --> 00:03:01,790
the pressure in my chest
bloomed beyond my control

54
00:03:04,433 --> 00:03:07,177
My body went from heat to
ice, I shrank into my dress and I

55
00:03:07,202 --> 00:03:09,990
could feel the rattle in my heart
sending blood up to my ears

56
00:03:12,566 --> 00:03:15,233
I couldn't even hear myself singing

57
00:03:19,033 --> 00:03:22,433
Later my cousin told me
I sang the entire song fine

58
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,633
It was only afterwards that
I grew pale and collapsed

59
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:34,666
Fainting after singing a
love song at a wedding

60
00:03:36,166 --> 00:03:37,133
How special

61
00:03:39,133 --> 00:03:42,633
An unforgettable song for
an unforgettable wedding

62
00:03:44,466 --> 00:03:48,233
Sin Ya and her partner
are together to this day

63
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:52,266
Did that love song keep
them together for this long?

64
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,533
I would like to think so

65
00:03:57,699 --> 00:03:59,733
Prevailing and so on

66
00:04:00,966 --> 00:04:03,566
Prevailing and so on

67
00:04:05,666 --> 00:04:09,533
I was diagnosed with arrhythmia
shortly after that incident

68
00:04:11,266 --> 00:04:13,256
If you are willing to believe it

69
00:04:13,281 --> 00:04:15,190
I've been monitoring my heartbeat since

70
00:04:16,866 --> 00:04:18,633
It's been two decades now

71
00:04:20,466 --> 00:04:23,124
If you didn't know the precariousness
of my condition you might

72
00:04:23,149 --> 00:04:25,557
assume this type of surveillance
of my health is overkill

73
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:31,199
The data of my heart
alone is well over 6 terabytes

74
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:38,133
I look for signs of turbulence over
the course of weeks, months, years

75
00:04:39,100 --> 00:04:43,300
I keep a journal and try to think of even
the smallest things that happen each day

76
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,300
To try to piece together
the root of my condition

77
00:04:49,866 --> 00:04:52,699
This is about my broken heart

78
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:57,000
THE END
